        "Name": "Crispy Vegan Hot Fried Drumsticks",
        "Category": "Appetizers",
        "Cuisine": "American",
        "Ingredients": "2 8.3 Oz Bags Vegan Smoked Drumsticks, 2 1/2 Cups Flour, 1/2 Tbsp Baking Powder, 1/2 Tsp Smoked Paprika, 1 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1 Tbsp Vegan Cajun Seasoning, 1 1/2 Tbsp Salt, 1/2 Tsp Freshly Ground Black Pepper, 1 Tbsp ACV or White Vinegar, 1-3 Tbsp Vegan Hot Sauce (Depending on spice preferance), 1 Cup Non-Dairy Milk (I used oat milk), Oil For Frying, Vegan Buttermilk Ranch (For dipping)",
        "TotalTime": "25 Minutes",
        "Yield": [12],
        "Instructions": "1. Start by defrosting your 2 8.3 Oz bags vegan smoked drumsticks if they are frozen. Once thawed, open the packages and pat the drumsticks dry with a paper towel on a plate. Set aside. 2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 tbsp baking powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 tbsp vegan cajun seasoning, 1 1/2 tbsp salt, and 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper until well combined. Set aside. 3. Then, in a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1 cup non-dairy milk of choice, 1 Tbsp ACV or White Vinegar, and 1 Tbsp-3 Tbsp vegan hot sauce depending on how spicy you want your wings. Season to taste with salt. 4. Next, grab a clean plate, the plate of drumsticks, and the wet and dry ingredient bowls to set up your dredging station. With a pair of metal tongs, grab a dry drumstick, then coat it in flour mixture, then coat it in the wet mixture, and then repeat one more time until the drumstick is double-battered and their last coat is flour. Set on the clean plate. Repeat those steps until all the wings are double-battered and evenly covered in batter. Set aside. 5. Next, heat a large pot or dutch oven with at least 3-6 cups of a high-heat oil for frying to 390°F-400°F. Grab a plate and line it with paper towels to absorb excess oil and set it near your frying oil. Then, grab a clean set of tongs and the double-battered plate of drumsticks. Slowly release a drumstick into the hot oil gently and carefully until submerged. Quickly repeat until there are 4-5 drumsticks in the hot oil. Fry for 3-5 minutes, turning gently halfway with tongs to get even-coverage, until drumsticks are golden brown. Carefully use a spider tool or tongs to grab drumsticks out and place onto the paper-towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Repeat until all wings are fried. Be sure to turn off oil and handle it safely. 6. Once all the drumsticks are fried, you can optionally brush more hot sauce or even vegan buffalo sauce onto the outside with a bbq brush onto each drumstick if you want to bring even more heat. Serve drumsticks hot with vegan ranch or vegan blue cheese for dipping. Enjoy!"

        "Name": "Fluffy Vegan Yeast Donuts",
        "Category": "Desserts",
        "Cuisine": "American",
        "Ingredients": "FOR DONUT DOUGH: 1/2 Cup Warm Water (110°F-115°F), 2 1/4 Tsp Yeast Active Dried Yeast or 1 Packet Active Dried Yeast, 1/4 Cup + 1 Tsp Organic White Sugar, 3/4 Cup Unsweetened Oat, Cashew, Coconut, or Soymilk (You want a thicker and creamier non-dairy milk for this recipe), 1/2 Cup Melted Vegan Butter, 1/4 Cup Vegan Sour Cream -OR- Unsweetened Vegan Yogurt, 3/4 Tsp Salt, 4 1/2 Cups Unbleached Organic All-Purpose Flour, High-Heat Oil (For frying; I used canola) FOR VANILLA GLAZE: 1 Cup Organic Vegan Powdered Sugar, 2 Tbsp Unsweetened Non-Dairy Milk, 1 Tbsp Mexican Vanilla or Pure Vanilla Extract FOR CHOCOLATE FROSTING: 1 Cup Organic Vegan Powdered Sugar, 2 Tbsp Vegan Butter, 4 Tbsp Vegan Cocoa Powder (Sieved), 1 Tsp Pure Vanilla Extract, 1/4 Cup Vegan Non-Dairy Milk, Vegan Colored Sprinkles (Optional) FOR JELLY FILLED: 1 Cup Organic Vegan Powdered Sugar, 11-12 Oz Jar Vegan Raspberry Jam (Seedless or seeded is fine depending on preference), Piping Tool -or- Piping Bag",
        "TotalTime": "3 Hours",
        "Yield": [12],
        "Instructions": "1. In a small bowl or glass liquid measuring cup, whisk warm water, 1 tsp of sugar, and yeast until well-combined. Set aside for 5 minutes or until yeast water becomes frothy and a visible layer has appeared on top of the water. 2. Next, whisk melted butter, vegan sour cream, non-dairy milk, and 1/4 cup white sugar. Then, whisk in activated yeast sugar water. Then, careful dump 4 1/2 cups flour into the wet mixture and the salt on top of the flour. Mix with a spatula until everything is well-combined and a sticky dough has formed. 3. Flour a clean surface, and turn the dough out onto it. Flour the top of the dough and your hands, and knead the dough for 3-5 minutes or until dough becomes smooth and shiny- but still slightly sticky. Form into a ball. Grease a large bowl, and place the ball of dough into the bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel, and place the bowl in a warm place. Let the dough rise for 1 1/2- 2 hours or until dough has doubled in size. 4. While dough is rising, prepare what options you want to have for your donut toppings. For the vanilla glaze, simply whisk everything together in a medium sized bowl and set aside. For chocolate frosting, simply whisk everything together minus the sprinkles until a thick frosting forms. Add more non-dairy milk tbsp by tbsp if too thick, and add more powdered sugar tbsp by tbsp if too thin. The texture should be like a regular chocolate butter cream. For the jelly filled, fill your piping bag with jam. Then, put 1 cup powdered sugar in a medium sized bowl. Refrigerate glaze, frosting, and jam before use. Cover the powdered sugar for the jelly filled option until use. 5. After dough has risen, punch it down to release gases. Then, flour a clean surface again and roll out the dough into a 1″ inch slab. Using a donut cutter, or a biscuit cutter and a small tool (like a test tube or a mini shot glass), cut out 12-14 regular donuts or just use a biscuit cutter without a small tool to make the filled donut option. If making all the options, cut 8 regular donut shapes and 4 jelly-filled donut shapes. I made mine to have 4 of each type. Once dough is all used up and donuts are cut into desired shapes, place donuts on two large baking sheets (6 on each) and cover both with tea towels to rest for another 25-30 minutes. 6. While donuts are proofing, grab a large stockpot or dutch oven. Fill your pot 1/2 way up with frying oil. Carefully heat your oil on high until it is 360°F-375°F Max. Use a thermometer to regulate the oils temperature between those two temps to prevent any accidents or burnt donuts. 7. Once donuts have proofed we are going to mis en place. Grab a set of metal tongs or a metal spider, grab 2 cooling racks and place them on top of a cutting board or grab two large baking sheets and cover them with paper towels for draining the excess oil off of the donuts. Have a fire extinguisher nearby to practice good kitchen safety in case of an accident. Lastly, have all of your toppings of choice/ fillings nearby. 8. After mis en placing, get ready to fry! GENTLY Place up to 3 donuts in the oil to fry at a time, being sure not to burn yourself or splash hot oil. We don’t want anyone to get hurt! Fry the donuts for 3-5 minutes on each side, or until light golden brown and cooked all the way through. Once done, set on cooling racks to drain or on lined baking sheets. You’ll want to wait at least 3 minutes after donuts are out of the fryer before you start handling them for decorating/filling. For vanilla glazed donuts, simply dunk either side of a warm donut into glaze until thoroughly coated, then set on cooling rack to dry for at least 20 minutes for glaze to harden. After that, enjoy! For the chocolate frosted donuts, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes before frosting- otherwise it’ll melt off! After 10 minutes, simply spread on chocolate frosting and top with sprinkles. Cool to set for at least 20 minutes. For the raspberry filled option, wait 3 minutes before handling. Take your piping bag and carefully plunge the metal tip into the bottom center of the donut, making sure not to penetrate the other side, and filling with raspberry jam as you come back out. Be sure to not over fill the donuts otherwise the jam could all fall out! Then, toss the donuts into the powdered sugar until thoroughly coated. Repeat these processes of choice until all donuts are fried and decorated. Once done, enjoy right away or seal in an air-tight container for up to 2 days. Enjoy!"
