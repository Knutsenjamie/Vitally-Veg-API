### Name of Student: Jamie Knutsen

### Name of Project: Recipe Ingredient Sorter

## Project's Purpose or Goal:

 The goal of this project is to allow a user to cycle through a recipe and have a grocery list generate based off of the ingredients in said recipe. 

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Cycle through at least 1-2 recipes, grab the ingredients from the recipe, and create a grocery list. 
* Use an API with recipes to have a database to sort through

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React
* MySql
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Possibly? C# Backend (more of a stretch goal- we will see what I can do)
If Building my own API doesn't work- I will use one of these. 
* [Tasty API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty)
* [Yummly API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yummly2)

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Application has ability to find repeated ingredients in multiple recipes and put said ingredient on list once (without repeating itself).    
* Make an API to implement from my existing recipes on my blog that I have already created myself. 
* If time and resources allow, find a way to integrate capstone into my actual wordpress site. 

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* My Blog (https://vitallyveg.com)
* My recipes from my blog (to create an API)

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? 

Iâ€™m super excited about this project but also nervous. It would be super cool to implement my capstone into my Wordpress site on my own instead of using an existing widget :). So, hopefully I can get there!
